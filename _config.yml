author_bio: Hi! I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at State Farm.
  I previously founded a startup, where I built an AI coach for gaming and grew it into a platform which helped over 1 million gamers improve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZxVJfhKmvs">(Demo)</a>.
  Before that, I built highly-scalable systems as a Software Engineer at Constant Contact

  spanning machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, fintech, data platforms, marketing automation, mobile, and advertisement
